# Songle
Get immersed into the world of songs! Check how good you are at recognizing lyrics.

Songle is a location-based game in which the player has to collect words by getting close to them and then guessing the song which they come from.

# Requirements
Phone with Android operating system with software version at least 5.0.

# About current version
Current version only allows the words to spawn in the Edinburgh University George Square campus area, however there are plans to change that. There are 30 songs available in the game, all with 5 difficulty levels (can be found here http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/cslp/data/songs/songs.xml). In the future separate server side with more songs may be implemented.

# How to run
The application is not available on Play Store so to run it one has to clone the current version of the project to Android Studio and then upload it to the device.
